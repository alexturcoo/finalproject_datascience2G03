# finalproject_datascience2G03
Final project for second year datascience course using C++. For this project, I modified a model of Trypanosome Infections to account for Co-infection of the Malaria Parasite. The goal of this project was to extend an existing model and analyze figures created using C++ to answer a biological question.
